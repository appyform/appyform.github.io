title: How (not) to build a tech startup in 10 weeks
---


Now that AppyForm has gone live, I can't wait to look back and let the thoughts sink in, to recollect what I have learnt, and how you could also build your startup in 10 weeks. Or in 5, if you could avoid the mistakes that I made. Some do it in a weekend.

## Built a startup? Seriously

But before we move on, I want to confess that the title is <del>a little</del> misleading. 

Yes, I have spent about 10 weeks to develop AppyForm, and it has gone to a stage of private-beta by the end of this effort. But has a startup been ***built***? In fact, will it ever be built? I mean, development done? Mission accomplished? No. Please, don't fool yourself.

It's more like getting to the end of a beginning. How did I do that...

## Do you want to build a startup?

If you are contemplating, or have contemplated in the past, the idea of building a startup, stop. Stop right here and ask yourself why you want to do it, because..

> ...half of the companies (startups) are silly, and you know two-thirds of them are going to go bankrupt...

Who dares to say such things about the almighty startups? About Facebook, Whatsapp, and so many other wonderful companies that have created jobs and wonderful creations that people love?

That guys's name is *[Bill Gates](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/14/bill-gates-its-ok-if-half-of-silicon-valley-startups-are-silly/)*.

Why would he say that? Probably because it's true. And it means that the odds of building a startup and making a fortune as a result of that are very much dim.


## If you believe in your startup product/service


The schedule of my 10 weeks goes like this,

### Things that seem easy could take hours, or days, or weeks

"It will take X (amount of time)". No it won't. It will take 2X, 3X, or 10X.


### Analysis paralysis = Bad

### Remember why you wanted to build it

One way or another, your challenges will be overcome, the gap can be bridged.
