title: How (not) to build a tech startup in 10 weeks, by yourself
---


Now that I have built AppyForm in about 10 weeks, I can't wait to look back and let the thoughts sink in, to recollect the events that have happened in this short time window and share, well, whatever I could, from this experience.

Before we move on, I have to confess that the title is ~~a little~~ misleading. 

Yes, I have spent about 10 weeks to develope AppyForm, and it has gone to a stage of private-beta by the end of this effort. But has a startup been ***built***? In fact, will it be ever built? I mean, done? Development completed? Probably not. Please, don't fool yourself.

Let me share how I got to the start of a startup in 10 weeks.

## So you want to build a startup?

Am I correct o assume that you are contemplating, or have contemplated in the past, the idea of building a start-up?

Stop. Stop right here and ask yourself why you want to do it, because..

> ...half of the companies (startups) are silly, and you know two-thirds of them are going to go bankrupt...

Who dare say that about the almighty startups of today? About Facebook, Whatsapp, and so many other wonderful things? 

That guys's name is *[Bill Gates](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/14/bill-gates-its-ok-if-half-of-silicon-valley-startups-are-silly/)*.

Why would he say that? Probably because it's true. And I guess that means the odds of good fortune 


## Schedule


## In hindsight

### Things that seem difficult sometimes turn out to be easy

Yes.

### Things that seem easy could take hours, or days, or weeks

### Remember why you wanted to build it

### Analysis paralysis = Bad

It will be done.

Yes, one way or another, your challenges 


## Epilogue

So, that's how I built my startup in (about) 10 weeks. Perhaps this will inspire you to  that's how it shouldn't have been done.
