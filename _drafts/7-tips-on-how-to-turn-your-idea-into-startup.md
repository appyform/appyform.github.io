title: 7 Tips on How to Turn Your Idea into a Startup
---


Next time the next-big-thing goes public, you may hear someone say something, with a grumpy face, along this line: "I had that idea long before they did!". It might even be you! 

Idea without execution is just that - an idea in your head, without any impact to the world. But how could you turn your idea into a startup? I would like to share some tips on this topic, something I learnt while founding AppyForm.


### Is your idea ready for execution?

Your idea may sound great, but is it a good time to run with it now? 

There are many reasons why an idea may not be ready for execution yet. The technology may not be mature enough. The development and production cost may be too high. The potential users may not be ready to change. May be too many competitions. There may not be a market for it. As someone famously said,

> ... half of the companies (startups) are silly, and you know two-thirds of them are going to go bankrupt ...

Yes, it is hard to say whether your idea is silly or ingenious. However if even yourself is not convinced about it, please don't go ahead.

By the way, who dares to say that startups are silly? His name is *[Bill Gates](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/14/bill-gates-its-ok-if-half-of-silicon-valley-startups-are-silly/)*. Maybe he's just pointing out the truth.




### Do you really want to execute it?

So you have a great idea. Congratulations! Now you want to run with this idea, build a startup and bring a new product or service to the world. Hold on - Why?

**Wrong answer #1: You want to make lots of money**

Statistics tell us that between two-thirds and 90% of startups failed (the number depends on sources). So the odds are, your startups will *lose* a lot of money rather than make a lot of moeny. To improve your odds of making money, you will be better off doing a good job and investing in stable fianancial assets.

**Wrong answer #2: You want to be your own boss**

This is a clich√© but worths repeating - when you are a boss, everyone will be your boss. Everyone is important and matters to the success of your business.

**Wrong answer #3: You want to work flexibly**

As Phil Libin, CEO of Evernote said in [his Standford ETL talk](http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2799), when you build a startup, you can work flexibly any 20 hours of the day. Yes, you can still call that flexibility.

**So what's a good answer?**

You want to do it because you are convinced that the world will be a better place with this product or service. Maybe someone is better served. Maybe it saves people time and energy. It is meaningful in its own right. You have so much passion for it that you don't care if it could bring you a lot of money. 

Believe me, it won't be all roses. If you build a startup for wrong reasons, you will be better off not starting it. 


### Opinions of others matter

Some people think that their ideas are so important and innovative that they keep them as their top secret. They would not discuss it with anyone, afraid that someone might steal the idea and the fortunes that follow. I know, I used to be one of them.

That's wrong. Why? 

Because, first of all, everyone is so busy doing their own thing! They are not going to drop their responsibilities to pursue your dream.

Secondly, if your idea can be easily stolen and copied by others, it will not end up being successful anyway. Competitions will catch up the moment it goes public.

And finally, you *need* the feedback from others. You may be good at what you do, but your idea won't be perfect. You definitely will miss some fine details. There may even be a flaw in your idea that only people with a particular experience would spot it. The later you change your plan, the more costly it will be.


### ... but not as much as yours

When you seek opnionios of others, a lot of people will say, "No, it's not going to work". Keep in mind that, if anyone else in the world is as convinced as you are about the idea, they would have done it already! You are seeking opinions of others to get feedback. Not approvals.

Opinions of others are important, but they are never as important as yours. You need to filter them wisely.



### Analysis paralysis = bad

Once you started 
A.k.a. Just Do It



### Do it yourself, or team up with someone

Either way you could do it.



### Keep going until it is done

You may 
Don't give up.


One way or another, your challenges will be overcome, the gap can be bridged. Good luck!
