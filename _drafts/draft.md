That was the question I kept asking myself after my mobile app has gone live.

Now that AppyForm has gone live, I can't wait to look back and let the thoughts sink in, to recollect what I have learnt, and how you could also build your startup in 10 weeks. Or in 5, if you could avoid the mistakes that I made. Some do it in a weekend.


## Built a startup? Seriously

But before we move on, I want to confess that the title is <del>a little</del> misleading. 

Yes, I have spent about 10 weeks to develop AppyForm, and it has gone to a stage of private-beta by the end of this effort. But has a startup been ***built***? In fact, will it ever be built? I mean, development done? Please, don't fool yourself.

It's more like getting to the end of a beginning. How did I do that...


## Do you want to build a startup?

If you are contemplating, or have contemplated in the past, the idea of building a startup, stop. Stop right here and ask yourself why you want to do it, because..

> ...half of the companies (startups) are silly, and you know two-thirds of them are going to go bankrupt...

Who dares to say such things about the almighty startups? About Facebook, Whatsapp, and so many other wonderful companies that have created jobs and wonderful creations that people love?

That guys's name is *[Bill Gates](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/14/bill-gates-its-ok-if-half-of-silicon-valley-startups-are-silly/)*.

Why would he say that? Probably because it's true. And it means that the odds of building a startup and making a fortune as a result of that are very much dim.
